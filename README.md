## Consumer app setup

### Using the Frutiger font files

> **IMPORTANT**: in order to use the Frutiger font in a production app, you must supply your app-specific own font licence for every variation of the font you wish to use (regular, bold, light etc.).

For a bare React Native app, a `react-native.config.js` file is needed with the following content to use the font files:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  assets: ['./node_modules/nhsuk-react-native-components/dist/assets/fonts/'],
};
```

Then run `npx react-native link` to link the font files to the native platform config files.
